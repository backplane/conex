# conex

This is a repository of source files for various utility [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_%28software%29) container images. The corresponding README file for each image usually has some information about how to use it. Feedback/contributions welcome. **Special thanks to the distro package maintainers who have volunteered to take on the responsibility of keeping their packages up to date!**

The image sources in this repo are automatically built at least once every 7 days and these <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/backplane/conex/tags">scheduled builds are published to <img src="/.assets/dockerhub.png" width="150" height="28" alt="docker hub"></a>.

The name "conex" is a reference to the [Conex box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container), the key component of [containerization (in freight transport)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization). Docker's creators make frequent use of the shipping container metaphor because the way that Docker standardizes (and thereby improves) the packaging, auditing, delivery, isolation, and use of *software* is analogous to the way the shipping container standardized (and thereby revolutionized) the packaging, tracking, isolation, and delivery of *freight*.

**LICENSE NOTE**: This repo contains code for installing and running 3rd party software packages in Docker containers. Unless otherwise noted the code in this repo is subject to the LICENSE file. The use of the generated images is subject to the terms of the respective software packages.
