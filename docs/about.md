# conex

This is a repository of source files for various utility [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_%28software%29) container images. The corresponding README file for each image usually has some information about how to use it. Feedback/contributions welcome.

The image sources in this repo have weekly <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/galvanist/conex/tags">scheduled builds published to <img src="/.assets/dockerhub.png" width="150" height="28" alt="docker hub"></a>

The name "conex" is a reference to the [Conex box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container), the key component of [containerization (in freight transport)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization). Docker's creators make frequent use of the shipping container metaphor because the way that Docker standardizes (and thereby improves) the packaging, auditing, delivery, isolation, and use of *software* is analogous to the way the shipping container standardized (and thereby revolutionized) the packaging, tracking, isolation, and delivery of *freight*.
