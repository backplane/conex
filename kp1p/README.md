# kp1p

[`python:3-alpine`](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/)-based dockerization of kp1p, a utility for translating csv files exported from KeePassX/KeePassXC into a csv format that is better supported by 1Password.

The program reads the given csv file an writes out a new csv file which can be imported into 1Password.

The image is hosted on GitHub in the [backplane/conex repo](https://github.com/backplane/conex/tree/main/kp1p).

## Usage

### Help Text

This is the output of the program's `-h` / `--help` output:

```
usage: kp1p.py [-h] [-o OUTFILE] [--overwrite] [--include-group] infile

Utility for translating csv files exported from KeePassX into a csv format that is better supported by 1Password

positional arguments:
  infile                the KeePassX-created csv file to be read

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        the filename of the 1Password-readable csv file to write (default: 1p_import.csv)
  --overwrite           enable overwriting the outfile if it already exists (default: False)
  --include-group       enable including the "group" field in the output file, this is normally excluded because of the suboptimal way "custom fields" are handled by 1Password (default:
                        False)

WARNING: KEEPASSX'S CSV EXPORT FUNCTION ONLY INCLUDES A VERY LIMITED SUBSET OF YOUR DATA. THINGS LIKE YOUR TOTP SEEDS WILL BE MISSING FROM THE CSV FILE GENERATED BY KEEPASSX!
